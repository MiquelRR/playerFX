# DINOS javafx exercice

This is an exercice to improve our skills in handling the [javaFX](https://openjfx.io/) framework. 
As usual, i've developed a bit more than exercice specks, such as contextual warnings and buttons.



## Develope Notes

The integrity of the MVC is kept clear as well as completely separating data access from the model, to make the application migratable to other data sources.
I have implemented a class that generates log files and in this case it is being used for data access.
